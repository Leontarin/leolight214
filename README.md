Greetings, I'm Leo.
♦ I am an aspiring Software Developer. <br/>
♥ I like Video games, video editing, graphic design, playing the Flute and create a bunch of projects in everything that interests me.
♠ Currently learning other forms of 'OUTPUT' other than <Windows.h> on C/C++
♣ So far I dabbled in C/C++ with simplistic programs like Snake, Tic Tac Toe and I/O shenanigans.
