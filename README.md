Greetings, I'm Leo.<br/>
♦ I am an aspiring Software Developer. <br/>
♣ So far I dabbled in C/C++ with simplistic programs like Snake, Tic Tac Toe and I/O shenanigans. <br/>
♥ I like Video games, video editing, graphic design, playing the Flute and creating a bunch of projects in everything that interests me. <br/>
♠ Currently learning: Git, MySQL, HTML+CSS and other forms of 'OUTPUT' other than <Windows.h> on C/C++ <br/>
